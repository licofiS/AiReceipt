# AiReceipt for Android-Study-Jams

Receipts using Machine Learning

<b> Problem Statement: </b>

Over a period of time, we are using traditional bills and receipts either handwritten or printed and it results into use a lots of paper, raw material and man power. This is a serious concern because more than 3 Million and 34 Billion water is used to make paper receipts in the world and as you know paper receipts are outdated and hard to track. This is a very big problem for the upcoming generation as we should switch to sustainable development and manage our resources very well.
Technology plays a vital role in day-to-day life activities which in turn made great changes in many work fields and out of them Mobile Application is one of the major developments. Mobile Application can be used effectively for this job as they are widely used and are known for easy access.

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

This project proposes a “AI Receipt” to make bill in the mobile either manually or by recognising some text by using ML Kit provided by Firebase and it will also keep track of the receipt made by the shopkeeper and it can be shared in the form of image to the customer. It can also be used in malls as this will reduce the manpower and usage of numerours computers which scan(using barcode) and make bills.

This project is very beneficial for small business owners as they can make bill fast and track it easily. The features of this application is that the application stores the details of inventory, it recognises the text from the grocery item packet and autofill the bill maker tab, so it reduces the time. If some item is not present in the inventory or if the item is not recognized by ML kit, then the user can make bill manually also. The bill made can be shared with the customer, so it will serve as an e-bill and the bill will also be stored in the application itself for the shopkeeper to track the bills and manage the inventory properly. Currently it is in the testing with the develper as more imporovements and bugs need to be solved and prepare it for production.

<b> Functionality & Concepts used : </b>

- The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the students select their route bus and track its location. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app : 
- Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
- Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for students to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
- RecyclerView : To present the list of different route busses we used the efficient recyclerview.
Google Maps API : We are also using the Google Maps API free version for  below 1000 users. In future if the user base increases we will go for the upgraded plan too.
- LiveData & Room Database : We are also using LiveData to update & observe any changes in the Bus driver's locations received from their mobile at real time and update it to local databases using Room. Coordinates are then updated in the bus route screen and students can track their route bus locations.

<b> Application Link & Future Scope : </b>

The app is currently in the Alpha testing phase with GNITS institute with a limited no. of users, You can access the app : [YOUR APP LINK HERE](either Github link or Google Play store link of published app or .apk file).

Once the app is fully tested and functional in GNITS institute, we plan to talk to neighboring colleges also to propose this app idea and collaborate with them on this transportation service. We aim that by next year most of the colleges in our district will use Bus tracking apps to check out their bus routes and be informed all the time. Also we are planning to include emergency SOS features for students traveling in busses if they are stuck somewhere.
